    <h1> Favorite Foods </h1>

    My abolsute favorite foods to eat are soup noodles! I love udon, pho, ramen,
    you name it! I also love to eat fruits, including mangos, avocados, watermelon, 
    and more. In terms of drinks, I really enjoy drinking water and coconut water
    every day!

    <h1> Favorite Bands </h1>

    I don't really listen to too many bands, but I absolute love the lumineers!! Some of their most favorite songs are Ophelia, Ho Hey,

    to on a roadtrip!
