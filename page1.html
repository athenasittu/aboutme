    <h1> Favorite Foods </h1>

    My abolsute favorite foods to eat are soup noodles! I love udon, pho, ramen,
    you name it! I also love to eat fruits, including mangos, avocados, watermelon, 
    and more. In terms of drinks, I really enjoy drinking water and coconut water
    every day!

    <h1> Favorite Bands </h1>

    I don't really listen to too many bands, but I absolute love the lumineers!! Some of their most favorite songs are Ophelia, Ho Hey, 
    and Cleopatra. Their songs are incredibly calming, vibey, and the perfect songs to sing along
    to on a roadtrip!
