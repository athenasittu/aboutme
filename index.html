    <h1> Hello, English 388 </h1>

    Hello everyone! My name is Athena. 
    I'm originally from San Francisco, but I've been raised in Greater Seattle for most of my life. 
    I love Seattle and how we have both city and country life here. 
    The mountains and the nature here are something I really enjoy 
    and I absolutely love going hiking and camping during the summer. 
    In addition, I really enjoy going on road trips to small towns. 
    Some other things about me are that I love thrifting, cooking, 
    watercoloring, reading, and more. Right now, the goal is to graduate 
    with a nursing degree, but in the future, I would love to travel the world
    and work as a travel nurse. After I do that for a couple of years, 
    I want to settle down and become a nurse practitioner.
