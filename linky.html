    In my article about the Elite, I learned it comes from the french word Ã©lite, 
    meaning to select. The elite which consists of a small group of individuals oftentimes
    have a lot of wealth and privilege. In addition, most of the time, political power as well. 
    The power elite is described to be a small group of individuals who 
    controls American policies. This includes governmental elites, corporate individuals, and the media.
